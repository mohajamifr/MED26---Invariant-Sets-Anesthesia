# MED26---Invariant-Sets-Anesthesia
This repository contains the code used to generate results for the paper "Guaranteed Stabilizing Control During Automated Propofol Anesthesia Based on the Theory of Robust and Contractive Invariant Sets" submitted for the MED26 conference.

1) the model_uncertainties file contains the code to generate the PK model with the associated uncertainty, adopted from the Python Anesthesia Simulator library;
2) the set_operations file contains several functions to perform different set operations;
3) the sets_propo notebook is the main file that illustrates how to generate the sets and use them for control.
